# Introduction to GitHub Codespaces

Welcome to the exciting world of GitHub Codespaces, your cloud based coding resource. In this module, we'll delve into the realm of instant, cloud-based development environments, revolutionizing the way you approach coding. GitHub Codespaces provides a seamlessly integrated experience, offering a container equipped with the essential languages, tools, and utilities for development.

Throughout this learning journey, we will embark on a discovery of the Codespaces lifecycle and processes. Uncover the power to tailor your Codespace setup to suit your unique preferences and requirements. To solidify your understanding, we'll cap off the module with a hands-on exercise, allowing you to flex your coding muscles within the GitHub Codespaces environment.

Imagine a fully configured development environment at your fingertips, accessible from any computer with an internet connection. GitHub Codespaces opens the door to a new era of collaborative and flexible coding. Let's dive in and unlock the full potential of cloud-based development with GitHub Codespaces!

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions?WT.mc_id=academic-113596-abartolo).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
